Basic Income Vancouver

Basic Income comes from a simple premise – that we have an obligation as Canadians to provide for the basic needs of people in our society.  We have a duty to provide our people enough needs security.  As a society we get to determine how much we can afford.  Who we provide for defines us as a society.  What we provide is a reflection of our compassion.

As advocates for Basic Income, we propose providing "an income unconditionally granted to all on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement" to all Canadians.

How we compromise on that idea defines us as a movement.  But let's not mislead ourselves, we will have to compromise on that idea in order for Basic Income to become a political reality.  The question is how, how much, and when.

Guy Standing describes five policy tests to assess socially just Basic Income policies.  We have found these principles to be helpful when thinking about compromise against the definition of Basic Income :-

* The Security Difference Principle – A policy or institutional change is socially just only if it improves the security of the least secure in society. 

"Does a Basic Income policy support the people who have the least security of basic needs in becoming more secure?"

The Security Difference Principle stems from Rawls, who from a liberal philosophical perspective essentially argued that social and economic inequalities are only just if they allow for the betterment of the worst-off groups in society (Rawls, 1973).

* The Paternalism Test Principle – A policy or institutional change is socially just only if it does not impose controls on some groups that are not imposed on the most free groups in society. 

"Is a Basic Income policy free of any judgment as to what is 'best' for someone?"

Underlying this principle is the Millian liberal view that there is a prima facie case against paternalism (except in the case of young children and those who are medically frail), particularly against those forms that constrain the freedoms of the disadvantaged.

* The Rights-Not-Charity Principle – A policy or institutional change is socially just if it enhances the rights of the recipient of benefits or services and limits the discretionary power of the providers. 

"Is the discretion in a Basic Income policy minimized?"

This third principle is also crucial for assessing alternative benefit schemes. A right is possessed by virtue of a person’s humanity or citizenship, and cannot be made dependent on some behavioural conditionality. Social and economic entitlements should be rights, not matters for the discretionary decisions of bureaucrats or philanthropists or aid donors.

* The Ecological Constraint Principle – A policy or institutional change is socially just only if it does not involve an ecological cost borne by the community or by those directly affected. 

"Does a Basic Income policy have an unsustainable cost to the environment?"

Benefit schemes should be subject to the constraint that they should not deliberately or carelessly jeopardise the environment.

* The Dignified Work Principle – A policy or institutional change is just only if it does not impede people from pursuing work in a dignified way and if it does not disadvantage the most insecure groups in that respect. 

"Does a Basic Income policy promote people's ability to make their own choices about the kind of paid work they do?"

The two-part test in this principle involves two implicit value judgements – that work that is dignifying is worth promoting (whereas any deterioration in working conditions or in opportunities would not be), and that the policy should enhance the range and quality of work options of the most insecure groups relative to others, or more than for others. The main point is to determine whether or not a scheme favours the development of more freely chosen work opportunities and work capabilities.



As the champions and owners of Basic Income in Canada, we have some measure of political power in that process, as we define what is Basic Income (and what isn't).  We understand the Basic Income conversation; we've seen the studies and the examples and counter-examples, and we have a very good intuitive understanding of what Basic Income looks like.  

We struggle to agree on the specifics.  We need to define for ourselves as a movement in Canada.  We need a set of Guiding Principles for Basic Income, and for now what we offer is what we are using in Vancouver.

Basic Income Vancouver has adopted these five principles as a framework for thinking about and discussing Basic Income.  It helps us.
